**ðŸ”§ TS Belt** is a library for functional programming in TypeScript. It solves the problem of the existence of both `undefined` and `null`. TS Belt is inspired by the [Belt](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/api/belt) module for ReScript/Reason.

### Features

- high tests coverage
- all functions are [curried](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-and-function-composition-2c208d774983)
- get rid of `undefined` and `null` values in your project in a convenient, functional way (use either `Option` or `Result`)
